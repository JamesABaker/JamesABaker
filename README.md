I'm James. I use computers to explore data. 💻📊 He/Him

My publications can be viewed on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=hbR8DVYAAAAJ&hl=en).
In academia, I studied transmembrane proteins in the context of structure and disease, and have moved to more technology-focused roles.


## How I like to work 

 - **Times ⏰**
    - I usually start between 9.30 and 10.00AM.
    - I don't always finish at the same time but it's usually between 6:30 and 7PM.
 - **Communication ✉️**
    -  Don't be alarmed if you get messages or emails from me outside of your work hours – I don't expect you to respond until you're back online.
    - I sometimes pop out for a coffee or a dog walk during the day. I'll do my best to flag this in slack. If you need me urgently, please call me ☎️
